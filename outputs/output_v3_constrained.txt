**Insights**
* Technology is the primary revenue driver for the business, generating 827,455.87, which is approximately 36.6% of total sales.
* Sales performance across the three main categories is relatively balanced, with only a 122,033.54 difference between the highest-performing category (Technology) and the lowest-performing top category (Office Supplies).
* The West and East regions are the core geographic markets, collectively contributing 1,379,738.41, or roughly 61% of the total revenue.

**Risks**
* There is a significant dependency on the West and East regions; any economic downturn or increased competition in these specific areas would jeopardize over half of the company's total revenue.
* The Office Supplies category is currently underperforming relative to Technology and Furniture, trailing the top category by 122,033.54 in total sales.

**Recommendations**
* Implement targeted growth strategies in the regions outside of the West and East to diversify geographic revenue and reduce regional concentration risk.
* Review the marketing and pricing strategy for Office Supplies to bridge the 23,236.25 gap between it and the Furniture category.
* Allocate additional R&D or inventory investment toward the Technology category to maintain its position as the market leader and primary revenue source (827,455.87).
